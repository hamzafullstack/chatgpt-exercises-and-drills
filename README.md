## **How This Works**
1. I upload **completed exercises** and their solutions.
2. I can request **new exercises** from ChatGPT for specific technologies or topics.
3. Each drill/exercise is stored in a **structured folder** for clarity:
    ```
    /html-css/
    /javascript/
    /react-js/
    /node-express/
    /mongodb/
    /tailwind/
    /python3/
    /flask/
    /django/
    /typescript/ (future)
    /other-tech/ (future)
    ```
4. Exercises range from **small coding challenges** to **mini-projects**.

---

## **Goal**
By organizing all exercises here, I aim to:
- Build a **strong portfolio of practice projects**.
- Become a **well-rounded full-stack developer**.
- Keep **learning structured, measurable, and reusable**.

---

## **How to Use This Repository**
- Browse exercises by technology or topic.
- Review my solutions to understand different approaches.
- Try to **solve the exercises yourself first** before checking my code.
- Contribute or suggest improvements if you want to collaborate.
