# Day 1: Your First HTML Website

---

### Core Concepts & Main Steps

1. **HTML Skeleton (Structure)**
   - Use `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`. Metadata goes in `<head>`, content in `<body>`.
   - This basic framework is required for every HTML page.

2. **Head Tags**
   - `<title>` tag is necessary – it shows the title in the browser tab.
   - `<link>` (for CSS) and `<script>` (for JavaScript) are used for external files.

3. **Content Structure (Headings, Paragraphs, Links)**
   - Use headings `<h1>`–`<h6>`, paragraphs `<p>`, and links `<a href="...">`.
   - These basic content elements form the page.

4. **Simple Page Layout**
   - Visualize a basic HTML page with a heading, paragraph, and link.
   - This is the foundation for more complex designs later.

### Challenge Task

Create a **mini HTML page** with the following:

- Proper HTML skeleton (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`).  
- A `<title>` tag (e.g., "My First Webpage").  
- One `<h1>` heading with any text.  
- One `<p>` paragraph with at least 2 sentences.  
- One `<a>` link that opens in a new tab (`target="_blank"`).

**Requirements:**

- Fully coded in a `.html` file.  
- No additional styling or external links—focus strictly on structure.

### Step-by-Step Execution

1. Create a new file named `index.html`.  
2. Write the **DOCTYPE** and HTML skeleton:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Your Title Here</title>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Content will go here -->
</body>
</html>
