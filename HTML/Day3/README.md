# Day 3: HTML Headings, Paragraphs, and Links

### Challenge Task

Create an HTML page that includes the following:

1. Proper HTML skeleton (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`).  
2. A `<title>` tag (e.g., "Day 3 Exercise").  
3. Three headings: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<h3>` with any text you like.  
4. Two paragraphs (`<p>`), each with at least one sentence.  
5. At least two links (`<a>`) pointing to websites of your choice, opening in a new tab (`target="_blank"`).

**Requirements:**

- Fully coded in a `.html` file.  
- No styling or external CSS/JSâ€”focus on HTML structure only.
