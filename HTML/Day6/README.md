Create a fully structured HTML form using proper semantic elements and labels.

### Requirements

  - **Email input** with label
  - **Password input** with label
  - **Textarea** with label (Comment)
  - **Dropdown (`select`)** with at least 3 options and label (Skills)
  - **Submit button**  
- Ensure labels use the `for` attribute correctly tied to the input `id`.
