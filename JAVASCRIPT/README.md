# JavaScript Exercises & Drills

This folder is all about my **JavaScript practice**.  
Here, I upload the **exercises, drills, and mini-projects** I do with the help of ChatGPT as my mentor/teacher.

---

## 📝 How This Works
- I **ask ChatGPT for exercises or challenges** on specific topics (variables, loops, DOM, etc.).
- I **write the code solutions** and push them here.
- I also **share what I learned** in each lesson or exercise.
- ChatGPT then gives me **feedback** and sometimes **mini-projects** to push my learning further.

So this folder is not just raw code — it’s my **learning log + solutions**.

## 📚 What’s Inside
- **Basics** → Variables, data types, operators, conditions, loops.
- **Functions** → Normal functions, arrow functions, scope, parameters.
- **DOM Manipulation** → Selecting elements, handling events, updating the UI.
- **ES6+ Features** → Template literals, destructuring, spread/rest, modules.
- **Mini Projects** → Small apps (like to-do list, number guess, calculator) for practice.
- **ChatGPT Feedback** → Notes and comments from ChatGPT on my solutions.

## 🎯 Purpose
- To **practice consistently** and track my growth in JavaScript.
- To **build problem-solving confidence** by doing drills.
- To use ChatGPT as a **mentor/teacher** who explains concepts, checks my work, and gives new challenges.

## 💡 Example Workflow
1. I ask ChatGPT: *“Give me an exercise on variables.”*  
2. I solve it and upload the code here.  
3. I write what I learned → e.g., *“I learned how variable hoisting works.”*  
4. ChatGPT gives feedback → e.g., *“Good, but try using `let` instead of `var`.”*  
5. If I do well → ChatGPT might give me a **mini-project**.

## 🚀 My Goal
Keep stacking **small wins**.  
Each exercise here is a brick. Together, they will build my **solid JavaScript foundation** before I move into frameworks and backend.
