    <h1>Exercise One by chatgpt</h1>
    <h2>Exercise (Fundamentals Only ðŸš€)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a new HTML file.</li>
        <li>Inside body, add two scripts:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Inline script that shows an alert "Inline Hello"..</li>
            <li>External script file test.js that shows an alert "External Hello".</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Open the page in your browser and observe:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Which alert comes first?.</li>
        <li>What happens if you swap the order of the script tags?.</li>

    </ul>
    <script>alert('inline Hello');</script>
    <script src="test.js"></script>
        <p>inline hello alert popups first then external</p>
    <p>if you swap the order of the script tags, external alert pops up first then inline</p>
    <p>this is because the inline script is executed immediately, while the external script is loaded and executed after the inline script.</p>
    <p>the external script is loaded asynchronously, so it does not block the execution of the inline script.</p>
    <p>this is a fundamental concept in JavaScript, and it is important to understand how scripts are executed in the browser.</p>
    <p>this exercise is a good way to practice your understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.</p>
